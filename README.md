# `germanicus`


## What's here

This repository hosts collaborative work between  the Holy Cross MID Club and participating secondary schools to edit manuscripts of Germanicus' Latin translation of the *Phaenomena* of Aratus (also known simply as the *Aratea*).  Our first project is Bern Burgerbibliothek 88.


We began work on this MS at our 2019 manuscripts hackathon.  You can find materials from our hackathon [here](https://hcmid.github.io/ms-hackathon-2019/)
