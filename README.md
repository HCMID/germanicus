# `germanicus`


## What's here

This repository hosts collaborative work between  the Holy Cross MID Club and participating secondary schools to edit Bern Burgerbibliothek 88,  Germanicus Caesar's Latin translation of the *Phaenomena* of Aratus (also known simply as the *Aratea*).  


We began work on this MS at our 2019 manuscripts hackathon, and continued in our 2020 hackathon.  You can find materials from our hackathons here:

## Spring, 2020, work plans

We plan to complete editing of the manuscript, including validation with morphological parsing.
